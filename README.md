# LamentOS System Configuration

This is my personal flake configuration for NixOS. Things have gone far past the 'simple flake for beginners' that I had initially thought after deciding I liked NixOS enough to daily drive it while making constant changes to my ricing and setup. So the project has now diverged: these are my 'system dotfiles', while I've been moving the module system (and expanding upon it) to [lamentos-modules](https://github.com/sarahlament/lamentos-modules), which is now a proper module system you can import and use in your own configuration, and my flake.nix can provide a 'documentation through use' example
