### LamentOS Configuration and NixOS Flake

Completely declaritive NixOS system and rice with no external files. My intent is to have a well commented flake that a beginner can look at and understand while providing a decent rice as a 'starting block'

Feel free to open any issues or merge requests with ideas or thoughts, only request is that it's decently documented enough so I can at least figure out what to Google to figure it out :3
