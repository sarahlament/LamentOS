### LamentOS Configuration and NixOS Flake

This is my personal flake configuration for NixOS. I've tried to make things as 'simple' as possible, so that anyone can look at and copy configurations as needed for things. I also eventually plan on doing a video series on my configuration when it's done, so look forward to that ;3

Feel free to open any issues or merge requests with ideas or thoughts, only request is that it's decently documented enough so I can at least figure out what to Google to figure it out :3
